  <div class="code-example__content">

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': np.random.randn(5),
    'B': np.random.randn(5),
    'C': np.random.randn(5),
    'D': np.random.choice(['X', 'Y', 'Z'], 5)
})

# Basic statistics
print(df.describe())

# Data filtering
filtered = df[df['A'] > 0]

# Group statistics
grouped = df.groupby('D').mean()
print(grouped)

# Pivot table
pivot = pd.pivot_table(df, values='A', index='D', aggfunc=np.mean)
