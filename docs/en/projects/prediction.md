## Overview of Prediction and Regression

Prediction and regression analysis is a core task in data mining, aiming to predict continuous numerical variables. Regression models learn the relationship between input features and the target variable to build a model that can predict target values for new data.

Prediction and regression analysis is widely applied in:
- House price prediction
- Sales forecasting
- Stock price analysis
- Energy consumption forecasting
- Anomaly detection
