## Project Overview

This section provides a series of data mining practical projects, closely related to core knowledge modules, helping you apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems. Each project includes:

- Detailed problem description
- Dataset introduction
- Implementation guide
- Evaluation criteria
- Advanced challenges

## Project Categories

We classify the projects according to core knowledge modules:

### Data Preprocessing Projects

- [E-commerce User Data Cleaning and Analysis](/en/projects/preprocessing/ecommerce-data.html)
- [Medical Data Missing Value Handling](/en/projects/preprocessing/medical-missing-values.html)

### Classification Algorithm Projects

These projects apply various classification algorithms to solve real-world problems:
- [Titanic Survival Prediction](/en/projects/classification/titanic.html)
- [Spam Filter](/en/projects/classification/spam-filter.html)
- [Credit Risk Assessment](/en/projects/classification/credit-risk.html)

### Clustering Analysis Projects

These projects use clustering algorithms to discover patterns in data:

## How to Use These Projects

### Learning Suggestions

1. **Combine Theory and Practice**: Each project corresponds to a specific knowledge module, so it‚Äôs recommended to study the related theory first.
2. **Gradual Progression**: The projects in each module are arranged by difficulty, starting from simple ones.
3. **Complete Implementation**: Try to independently complete the entire project process, from data acquisition to result interpretation.
4. **Compare Methods**: Try different algorithms and methods to solve the same problem.
5. **Document the Process**: Maintain good documentation practices to record decisions and results.

### Project Workflow

It is recommended to follow the following workflow for each project:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Carefully read the project description and clarify the goals and evaluation criteria.
2. **Explore the Data**: Analyze the dataset‚Äôs features and understand the data distribution and relationships.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values and outliers.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create and select effective features.
5. **Model Building**: Choose and train an appropriate model.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Use suitable metrics to evaluate the model's performance.
7. **Result Interpretation**: Interpret the model's results and business implications.
8. **Improvement Iteration**: Improve the solution based on evaluation results.
