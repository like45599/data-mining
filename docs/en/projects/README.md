- Implementation guide
- Evaluation criteria
- Advanced challenges

## Project Categories

We classify the projects according to core knowledge modules:

## How to Use These Projects

### Learning Suggestions

1. **Combine Theory and Practice**: Each project corresponds to a specific knowledge module, so it’s recommended to study the related theory first.
2. **Gradual Progression**: The projects in each module are arranged by difficulty, starting from simple ones.
3. **Complete Implementation**: Try to independently complete the entire project process, from data acquisition to result interpretation.
4. **Compare Methods**: Try different algorithms and methods to solve the same problem.
5. **Document the Process**: Maintain good documentation practices to record decisions and results.

### Project Workflow

It is recommended to follow the following workflow for each project:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Carefully read the project description and clarify the goals and evaluation criteria.
2. **Explore the Data**: Analyze the dataset’s features and understand the data distribution and relationships.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values and outliers.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create and select effective features.
5. **Model Building**: Choose and train an appropriate model.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Use suitable metrics to evaluate the model's performance.
7. **Result Interpretation**: Interpret the model's results and business implications.
8. **Improvement Iteration**: Improve the solution based on evaluation results.
