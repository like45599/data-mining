## Importance of Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is one of the most critical steps in the data mining process, often taking up 60-70% of the project time. High-quality data preprocessing can significantly improve model performance, while neglecting this step can result in "garbage in, garbage out."

Data preprocessing primarily addresses the following issues:
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Standardizing and normalizing data
- Converting data formats
- Creating and selecting effective features
- Dimensionality reduction and data balancing

## List of Preprocessing Projects

The following projects focus on the application of data preprocessing techniques, helping you master this essential skill:

## Data Preprocessing Skill Enhancement

By completing these projects, you will master the following key skills:

### Missing Value Handling Techniques
- Identify missing value patterns (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)
- Apply different imputation methods (mean/median/mode imputation, KNN imputation, model-based imputation)
- Evaluate the impact of different imputation methods

### Outlier Detection and Handling
- Use statistical methods to detect outliers (Z-score, IQR method)
- Apply machine learning methods to identify outliers (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM)
- Choose the appropriate outlier handling strategy

### Basic Feature Engineering
- Create derived features
- Feature encoding (one-hot encoding, label encoding, target encoding)
- Feature transformation (log transformation, Box-Cox transformation)
- Feature standardization and normalization
