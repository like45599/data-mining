## Overview of Classification Algorithms

Classification is one of the most common tasks in data mining, with the goal of assigning data points to predefined categories. Classification algorithms build models that predict the category of new data by learning patterns from labeled data.

Classification algorithms are widely used in:
- Spam email filtering
- Customer churn prediction
- Disease diagnosis
- Credit risk assessment
- Image and text classification
