## Overview of Clustering Analysis

Clustering analysis is an unsupervised learning method that aims to group similar data points into the same cluster while ensuring that data points in different clusters are as distinct as possible. Clustering does not require labeled data; instead, it groups data by discovering inherent structures and patterns.

Clustering analysis is widely used in:
- Customer segmentation
- Image segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Document classification
- Gene expression analysis

      <li><strong>K-Means</strong>: Suitable for spherical clusters, requires the number of clusters to be specified in advance, sensitive to outliers</li>
      <li><strong>Hierarchical Clustering</strong>: Does not require specifying the number of clusters, can generate dendrograms, but computationally complex</li>
      <li><strong>DBSCAN</strong>: Can discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, automatically identifies noise points, does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance</li>
      <li><strong>Gaussian Mixture Models</strong>: Based on probabilistic models, allows clusters to have different shapes and sizes</li>
      <li><strong>Spectral Clustering</strong>: Suitable for non-convex shaped clusters, but computationally expensive</li>
