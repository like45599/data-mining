## Common Questions for Beginners

### How to Overcome Fear of Mathematics?

Many beginners worry about their math foundation. It is recommended to:

- Learn from an application perspective, first understanding the use and basic principles of algorithms
- Use visualization tools to understand mathematical concepts
- Gradually delve deeper; there is no need to master all the math details right away
- Strengthen understanding through real-world applications

### How to Choose Your First Project?

When choosing your first project, consider:

- Starting with classic datasets (e.g., Iris, Titanic)
- Choosing structured data over unstructured data
- Beginning with basic tasks like classification or regression
- Selecting problems with clear evaluation criteria

### How to Learn Efficiently?

Efficient learning tips include:

- Combine theory with practice; apply what you learn as you go
- Participate in learning communities and discuss problems with others
- Develop a reasonable study plan, progressing step by step
- Keep learning notes and track the problems you encounter
